        <p>So let's talk about magic. magic is taking a thought and making it real. Taking a lie and making it the truth. Telling a story to the universe so utterly, cosmically perfect that for a single, shining moment... the world believes a man can fly</p>

        <h4>Loki is more than we all realise, more than we will ever realise.</h4>
        <p>
           Loki is supposed to live, to exist beyond time to write the stories, 
          Everything that’s written, everything that will ever be written, - Loki is the agent, of fates. Loki is supposed to make sure things go the way they are supposed to.  
          </p>
        
        <p> 
          Loki makes sure everyone gets what they deserve. 
          And that is what makes him special. 
          </p>
        
        <p>Only LOKI can break through, These cycles, these patters, these loops. Only Loki supports and thrives. And only Loki wil live. When the world is dead, when there is nobody left, Loki will live and Loki will bring – a new life and new stories.
          Afterall, he IS the god of stories.
